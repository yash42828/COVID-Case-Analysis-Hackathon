COVID Case Prediction
COVID Case Prediction predicts the total number of confirmed cases, total number of death cases and total number of recovered cases based on the future dates which users provide.

The problem COVID Case Prediction solves
As the saying goes 'Prevention is always better than cure.'
In the Existing Scenario we are only aware of the number of cases till date, but this model gives us the prediction about future cases of COVID-19 based on current situation. This can prove to be very helpful to the Government in a way, that they can take all the necessary steps needed to stop the pandemic from spreading more. This also helps in making all the necessary arrangements to fight against the pandemic. Also if the data is available to the common people they can be aware of the situation and play their role by staying at home.In the Existing Scenario we can only see the number of cases till the current date, but this project gives you the prediction of the future dates so that Government can take necessary steps to prevent the problem of COVID and it also provides you the helpline details and basic protective measures against the new coronavirus.


Challenges we ran into
First and foremost as the COVID-19 virus is new we had a hard time finding dataset to train our model.
